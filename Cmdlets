To get only commands that have been imported into the          current session, use the ListImported parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Without parameters, `Get-Command` gets all of the cmdlets, functions, and aliases installed on the computer. `Get-Command *` gets all types of commands, including all      of the non-PowerShell files in the Path environment variable (`$env:Path`), which it lists in the Application command type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             `Get-Command` that uses the exact name of the command, without wildcard characters, automatically imports the module that contains the command so that you can use the      command immediately. To enable, disable, and configure automatic importing of modules, use the `$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference` preference variable. For more               information, see about_Preference_Variables (About/about_Preference_Variables.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      `Get-Command` gets its data directly from the command code, unlike `Get-Help`, which gets its information from help topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, results of the `Get-Command` cmdlet display a Version column by default. A new Version property has been added to the CommandInfo       class.
